## Bitcoin Cold Storage

### [Hodl Guide](https://github.com/HelgeHunding/guides/blob/master/hodl-guide/README.md)

The full "Hodl Guide". Once done with this, you'll have a secure and private cold storage. The guide might be overwhelming if you are new to hardware wallets and/or Linux. If that's the case, consider starting with one of the light-guides. You can always upgrader later.

### [Hodl Guide Light](https://github.com/HelgeHunding/guides/blob/master/hodl-guide-light/README.md)

This is an excellent place to start if you want to create your first cold storage wallet. All you need is one hardware wallet and an internet connected computer. It'll give you a secure base and a possibility to upgrade that at a later date. In most cases, you'll be up and running within one hour.

### [Hodl Guide Light, Multi-Sig](https://github.com/HelgeHunding/guides/blob/master/hodl-guide-light-ms/README.md)

This is if you want to upgrade the light guide and make it even more secure. Use two different hardware wallets to create a multi-sig wallet. This'll use the strength different manufacturers wallets have. Both hardware wallets (or their seeds) needs to be compromised for you to lose your funds.
