# The Ultimate Hodl Guide

---

Bitcoin gives you the possibility to store value in ways earlier generations only could dream about. A common man can store value in a more secure and trust minimized way then any king throughout history. If done right, no one even needs to know what you own.

I wrote this guide in my own quest to becoming a first-class Bitcoin citizen. A first-class Bitcoin citizen has control of his own keys, runs his own full node to validate all transactions and does this in a secure and private way. I’m no technical expert myself, so this guide only uses tools that’s been properly battletested throughout the years. The goal of the guide is to find a middle ground in the constant battle between usability and security. More bitcoin has probably been lost because of a complicated process with paper wallets then has been stolen. This guide uses HD-wallets with mnemonic seeds (12-24 regular English words) for your private keys that reduce the risk of fatal mistakes. In the end of the guide, you'll have a reliable and secure **cold storage**!

## Who is this for?

The guide is for everyone who wants to store their bitcoin in a secure way (you don’t need any specific technical knowledge). You should have a basic understanding of what a private key is and why it´s important to store it in a secure way. The guide is flexible and can be utilized in different ways. The full setup is with two different hardware wallets and one backup key created with the Tails operating system. The most time consuming, and slightly more technical, part is related to Tails. You could skip that part for an easier (but less secure) setup. If you don’t trust, or want to buy, hardware wallets you could do the whole setup with 3 keys in Tails. If you make modifications to the guide, you'll have to adjust accordingly. The full setup should take 2-3 hours, excluding download and sync-times. The guide is meant for normal users and not individuals that might be extra targeted for specific attacks (but they can probably use parts of the guide).  

## Privacy

The guide gives you the opportunity to create a very private storage solution as well. Those parts are optional (but recommended). They don’t directly affect the security of your private keys. But they reduce the risk of being the victim of a targeted attack (virtual or physical). The privacy parts are marked with a **[P]**. Privacy isn’t black and white and every situation is different. I would recommend to at least try a few of the methods that might work for you. It’ll probably payoff in the long run. The best security for your bitcoin is probably that no one knows that you own them in the first place.
If you want two deep dives about why privacy is very important, check out https://medium.com/human-rights-foundation-hrf/privacy-and-cryptocurrency-part-i-how-private-is-bitcoin-e3a4071f8fff and https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy.

At the end of the guide, you’ll have a set of private keys and a plan to store those in a secure way. That includes the possibility for people you trust to access them (if they collaborate which each other) in case of an emergency.

## Cold Storage

This is a guide for Cold Storage. Only put funds that you don’t need to access frequently in cold storage. If you have more then a few $1000 worth of bitcoin a good starting point could be to store 70-90% in cold storage, 10-30% in a hardware wallet and 0-10% in a hot wallet on your phone or computer (lightning etc). 

I, or no one else, is responsible for your funds. This guide gives you the tools, but you have to evaluate and perform all the steps yourself. Only you are responsible for your bitcoin. Grow a spine and start loving it!
