# Create the multi-sig wallet with Electrum

We are using Electrum on our main computer to construct the multi-signature wallet.


### Download and verify Electrum

On your main computer (or regular OS) go to https://electrum.org/#download
For our multi-sig to work on both systems, you might need the same version of Electrum as the one used in Tails. But first we need the signing key of Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the “Public Key” link (you can skip this on Linux and use gpg --import ThomasV.asc):
![Electrum 10](images/40_electrum_10.png)
That should take you to a page with the public key, use `Ctrl+S` and save the file `ThomasV.asc` on your computer.

Go back to https://electrum.org/#download and check what the latest release is. Chanses are that the latest release is newer then the one used in Tails. If that´s the case we need an older release, click “Previous releases”:
![Electrum 11](images/40_electrum_11.png)
That should take you to https://download.electrum.org/. Go to the folder with the same version number as the one in Tails (for example 3.1.3 with Tails 3.12.1). Download the file for your OS (tar.gz for Linux, -setup.exe for Windows and .dmg for macOS) and make sure to download the corresponding .asc file as well. Put the files in the same folder as ThomasV’s signing key:
![Electrum 12](images/40_electrum_12.png)
*Note*, if you´re already using a newer version of Electrum. Downgrading the version might make wallets created with newer versions temporary unusable. Once done with the cold storage, you can upgrade to a newer version of Electrum and everything should work again. Your funds aren´t at risk, you can always recover your funds (or import to an older version) with your recovery seed. 

Once downloaded we need to verify the download in the same way we verified Tails. 
Open a terminal (for example Powershell on Windows).
Change the current directory to the one where the 3 downloaded files are located: 

`$ cd $HOME/Downloads` 

Import the signing key from ThomasV into your local GPG installation: 

`$ gpg --import ThomasV.asc` 

Now use the .asc to check that the Electrum installer was signed with the signing key we imported: 

`$ gpg --verify tails- electrum-3.1.3-setup.exe.asc electrum-3.1.3-setup.exe` (make sure to change the file name on both places if using a newer version). 
The verification can take a while. 

Expected output:
```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'electrum-3.1.3-setup.exe'
gpg: Signature made 04/18/18 17:10:44 W. Europe Daylight Time
gpg:                using RSA key 2BD5824B7F9470E6
gpg: Good signature from "ThomasV <thomasv1@gmx.de>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6
```
The signing was made the same day as the release was uploaded (should be around the same time). 
It´s a `Good signature`. 
A search online on `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6` seems to verify that this key belongs to Thomas V. We are good to go. Install Electrum and follow the instructions on screen.

### Start creating the multi-sig

Start Electrum. We are going to create a new wallet. If you already have a default Electrum Wallet open, go to `File>New/Restore` (or use Ctrl+N). Otherwise the install wizard should be launched automatically. 

Pick a name for your multi-sig wallet and click Next:
![Electrum 13](images/40_electrum_13.png)
Select "Multi-signature wallet" and hit Next:
![Electrum 14](images/40_electrum_14.png)
Change the first slider to 3 cosigners (with 2 signatures required) and click Next:
![Electrum 15](images/40_electrum_15.png)
Start with the seed you created in Tails. Select “Use a master key”:
![Electrum 16](images/40_electrum_16.png)
Click the QR-code in the bottom right corner:

## Troubleshooting 
If you get the following error:
![Error 1](images/40_error_1.png)
You’ll probably need to install “Zbar” (or launch it if it’s installed). It’s available at http://zbar.sourceforge.net/ and you can view the source code at https://github.com/ZBar/ZBar. (Only Windows and Linux). It’s generally a good idea to not download random programs from file hosting sites. But Zbar has been around a long time and we can try to ensure it’s a legit copy. If you still don’t want to use Zbar, scroll down to “other solutions”- Otherwise go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/zbar/files/zbar/0.10/. Make sure that “Modified” is 2009-10-XX:
![Zbar](images/40_zbar.png)
Download the file for your operating system (.exe for Windows and tar.gz or tar.bz2 for Linux). No digital signatures are provided, so we are going to generate the SHA256-checksum of the file. Open a new terminal and change the directory to where the file is located:

`$ cd $HOME/Downloads` 
Generate the checksum:
*on Windows* `> Get-FileHash -a sha256 zbar-0.10-setup.exe`
You should get the following output: 
![Zbar hash](images/40_zbar_hash.png)
*on Linux*: 
`$ sha256sum zbar-0.10.tar.gz`
Should produce the output:
`575fa82de699faa7bda2d2ebbe3e1af0a4152ec4d3ad72c0ab6712d7cc9b5dd2  zbar-0.10.tar.gz`
And:
`$ sha256sum zbar-0.10.tar.bz2`
Should produce the output:
`234efb39dbbe5cef4189cc76f37afbe3cfcfb45ae52493bfe8e191318bdbadc6  zbar-0.10.tar.bz2`

It’s the best we can do here and Zbar won’t be handling any critical information. If the hashes match, you know that you’ve got the same file that was used in this guide. If you are okey with that, go ahead and install Zbar and follow the instructions on the screen. Go back to Electrum and click the QR-code, you might have to try 2-3 times before it starts. 

If it still doesn’t start, start the program “zbarcam”, pick a video source, click apply and try in Electrum again:
![Zbarcam](images/40_zbarcam.png)

Scan the QR-code in Electrum. It should read your xpub key and Electrum should automatically show it. 

Other solutions:
If you can’t launch or don’t want to use Zbar, you could use a workaround. 

Option 1 is to simply download another QR-reader on your computer (or check if you have one installed) and scan the QR-code. Copy the scanned result to Electrum. 

Option 2, use a QR-code reader on your smart-phone. Load the photo to the QR-code reader, connect to internet and send the text to your computer with a secure messaging app. 

Option 3, use an online-service like https://webqr.com/index.html. Know that you risk to leak your public key to a third party (which reduces your privacy but isn’t terrible in this case since it’s only 1 of 3 needed keys). Copy the result to Electrum.
