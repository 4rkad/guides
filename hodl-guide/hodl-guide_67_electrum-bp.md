## Electrum best practises

*Difficulty: medium*

You have your cold storage wallet created and you want to start using it. But how do you keep your wallet private?

Privacy isn't black or white. It's a scale where every privacy leak can be used against you (the more the worse). All bitcoin transactions are public so you can leave traces on chain. You can also leave traces off chain. For example when you broadcast transactions or use your real name to purchase things with bitcoin. 

How much effort you put in to protect your privacy depends on your personal threat level and how much bitcoin you protect. How much time and effort is it worth to put in to secure your bitcoin the best you can?

If you have taken the time to create a cold storage wallet, I would advise you to at least look at some of the easiest solutions that'll give you most "bang for your bucks".

### Short version

* Use Wasabi Wallet as a spending wallet and never use your cold storage wallet to directly send funds to someone else. Or use the lightning network (mix funds with Wasabi before depositing to your lightning wallet).
* Mix all bitcoins with Wasabi Wallet or Joinmarket before depositing to your cold storage.
* "Top up" your spending wallet with whole UTXOs (coins). Do not produce any change in your cold storage wallet.
* If you don't have Electrum connected to your own full node, mix all coins going out of your cold storage wallet.
* [Setup Electrum to run over Tor](hodl-guide_66_electrum-tor.md). Or even better connect it to your full node with Electrum Personal Server (guide for [Windows](hodl-guide_63_eps-win.md) and [Mac](hodl-guide_64_eps-mac.md) and have it running over Tor.
* Do not look up your addresses on any block explorers.

A solid setup would be:

`Electrum multi-sig wallet > Electrum Client > Electrum Personal Server > Bitcoin Core > Tor`

### Long version

Create a separate spending wallet so you have at least one spending wallet and one cold storage wallet.

#### Wasabi Wallet

I would recommend [Wasabi Wallet](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) ([Tor link](http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/)) as a spending wallet . Wasabi wallet is designed to be a spending wallet. A bitcoin is only an unspent output from a previous transaction (UTXO). Wasabi gives you control of these outputs. It also offers an excellent option to mix your coins with coin join. You can find a guide with more information [Here](hodl-guide_62_wasabi-wallet.md).

When you spend bitcoin, you usually link different UTXOs together to construct the payment and then send some of it back to yourself as change. If you aren't careful, this can be used to cluster many addresses in your wallet together. It's not fool proof, but someone watching the block chain could assume that a cluster of addresses belongs to you. If you then use one address in the cluster to example buy something and ship it to your home or deposit bitcoin to an exchange that use KYC. Many more addresses can be linked to you.

This heuristic can be broken if you use coinjoin. One method is to use Wasabi Wallet (or Joinmarket) to mix all your coins before depositing to cold storage. Then it doesn't really matter what you've done with the coins before. It can be a good idea to keep a few mixed outputs in Wasabi Wallet and use that if you'd like to spend bitcoin. Remember that Wasabi Wallet is a hot wallet. Treat it like cash in your pocket and don't keep larger amounts in it. Then you can top up your Wasabi Wallet as needed. Either by buying more at an exchange (and mix) or depositing from your cold storage. You can find a few [best practises for Wasabi Wallet](hodl-guide_62_wasabi-wallet.md) in the bonus section.

#### Withdraw whole UTXOs

Always try to withdraw whole outputs from your cold wallet. This way, you won't produce any change that you have to keep track of. To do this in Electrum, go to the `Coins` tab. Right click on the address you'd like to spend from. Select `Spend`. Then fill in the receiving address and select "Max" on the `Send` tab. You can send more then one output in the same transaction, but know that they'll be linked together. If you want to do this, select multiple outputs by holding ctrl/cmd and marking the outputs.

If you don't run your own full node and connect Electrum to it with for example Electrum Personal Server, you'd have to mix your outputs again if you'd like to keep your privacy. Electrum uses specialised servers that will know of all your used addresses. Anyone can run a server and you'll be connected to one randomly by default.

Even if you use Tor you are still giving all your addresses to some random server. Tor will hide your real IP, but the server will still know which addresses belongs together. If you say, transfer one whole UTXO to Wasabi but doesn't mix. At a later date you deposit this output to an exchange that knows your name. This exchange collaborates with a company that analyse the blockchain. If this company runs an Electrum server that you once connected to, it's trivial to track your deposit back to your wallet. They will know your whole wallet balance and now your name. If you doesn't use Tor (or a VPN), this will be even easier. The server has your IP-address and the exchange can se that you log in with the same IP on their site.

If you mix your coins before depositing, it'll be much much harder to trace it back to your wallet. It'll be like a firewall that protects your cold storage. This will be more effective if you use Tor or a VPN (Tor is better as you will constantly change your IP-address).

That's why the next recommendation is to configure Electrum to run over Tor. You can find a guide for that [here](hodl-guide_66_electrum-tor.md). That's only if you can't run a full node and connect Electrum to that. With a full node you will download every transaction and every block. No one can know what transactions you are looking for. This will always be a problem with "light wallets". They don't download everything by definition. That means that you are asking someone about some specific information. This can be used to connect your addresses together. You can find a guide for setting up Bitcoin Core, [here](hodl-guide_61_bitcoin-core.md), for connecting your full node to Electrum with Electrum Personal server, you can find a guide for Windows [here](hodl-guide_63_eps-win.md) and for Mac [here](hodl-guide_64_eps-mac.md).

If you use your full node (especially if it use Tor), there really isn't any need to mix your coins when withdrawing. As long as you avoid producing change and always send whole UTXOs out of your wallet. Unless someone has your master public key, it should be very hard to cluster the addresses in your wallet together. However, if fees are low and you have the time, there's no harm in mixing again.

Last but not least. Do not go and look up any of your addresses on a block explorer. You will destroy a lot of the hard work you put in. Who else then you would go to a block explorer and look up one of your addresses? Maybe multiple times or right after a transaction with a few updates until the transaction is confirmed. If you do this with your real IP-address, it's a clear indication that the address belongs to you and this will probably be saved somewhere. If you really need to look it up for some reason, use the Tor browser. The block explorer will then know that someone looked up an address. But it can't know who. You could for example use blockstream.info with their onion address http://explorerzydxu5ecjrkwceayqybizmpjjznk5izmitf2modhcusuqlid.onion/ for maximum privacy.

This will take you a long way in keeping your cold storage private.



To be a true Bitcoin first class citizen you need to run your own Bitcoin full node and validate all transactions yourself. That way you don't rely on trusted third party servers and as a bonus improves your privacy.


The second-best option is to use your Bitcoin full node to add watch addresses. You simply add all addresses you want to keep track off and your node checks for any activity on those addresses. If you have a full node running, this is very simple. Check the bonus section for how to [add watch addresses in Bitcoin Core](hodl-guide_65_watch-address.md). Youâ€™d still have to connect to random Electrum servers to broadcast transactions, but that isn't terrible if you use Tor or a VPN. The crucial part is to validate every transaction you receive.

Another very important aspect of privacy is what traces you leave on chain. A very common example is that you buy bitcoin on an exchange that use KYC (know your customer). They then have all your personal information. If you then transfer your funds directly from the exchange to your cold storage, they would still know what bitcoin you most likely own. There are multiple other ways your funds can be linked to you and you never know who has this information. An easy way to break this link is to mix your coins with a technique called coinjoin. This has often been done by central parties, I would advice against those services. You put your trust in them, both with your privacy and with your keys as they could steal your bitcoin. A better alternative is to use a service that never control our keys. Two alternatives are [Joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket) and Wasabi Wallet. You can find a guide and best practises for [Wasabi Wallet](hodl-guide_62_wasabi-wallet.md) in the bonus section.

*Note:* Some exchanges treat coins involved in coin join transactions as suspicious. If you do a coin join transaction and then tries to transfer the coins to an exchange, they might reject your deposit. You have to decide yourself about privacy vs ease of selling.
