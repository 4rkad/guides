# Preparations

## Mandatory Hardware Requirements for Full Setup

*	1 USB-drive with 8GB+ memory. Consider buying a new one used only for this purpose.
*	2 different Hardware-wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard etc). Make sure the hardware-wallets are from two different manufacturers (e.g. one Trezor and one Ledger). You can use existing devices if you already own some (but you’ll probably have to wipe them ant can’t use them for other purposes afterwards). If you are buying new ones, make sure to only buy from the official store (ref link if you want to support the author TREZ, LEDG, COLDCARD)
*	1 internet connected computer. Could be your normal computer. Should have at least 1 USB-slot and a camera (for reading QR-codes). If you only use one computer, the computer needs to have a 64-bit processor.
*	1 Smartphone (or digital camera with screen)
